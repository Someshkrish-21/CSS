       <h1>LAMBORGHINI</h1>
       <p class="paragraph1">Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916â€“1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. 
       The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide 
financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978.</p>
       <h2 font>JAGUAR</h1> 
       <p class="paragraph2">Jaguar was spun off from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, becoming a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired 
by Ford in 1990.[4] Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010.[5] The company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles.[6]</p>
       <h1>AUDI</h1>
       <p class="paragraph3">The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), 
       leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.</P>
